# Finance Analysis Loan Default Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to leverage SQL Queries and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to conduct risk analysis for loan default prediction in the context of a consumer finance company. By analyzing historical loan application data, we will identify patterns and factors that indicate whether a client is likely to default on their loan payments. This analysis will assist the company in minimizing financial losses while ensuring that creditworthy applicants are not unfairly rejected.

## Business Understanding

The lending industry faces significant challenges in assessing creditworthiness, particularly for applicants with limited or no credit history. Loan defaults pose financial risks to lending institutions, making accurate risk assessment crucial. Our primary objective is to use EDA techniques to understand the drivers behind loan default and develop strategies to mitigate these risks effectively.

## Business Objectives

Identify patterns indicating clients' difficulty in repaying loans through detailed analysis of application data.
Utilize insights gained from the analysis to inform portfolio management, risk assessment, and lending practices.
Develop strategies to minimize financial losses due to loan defaults and optimize lending decisions.
Data Analysis Approach

### Data Collection: 
Gather historical loan application data including applicant information, loan details, and repayment status.

### Data Preprocessing: 
Cleanse and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

### SQL Queries:
Using PANDASQL queries to get insights from the dataframe

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Explore the distribution of key variables such as income, credit score, and loan amount.
Analyze the relationship between various factors and loan default status.
Visualize patterns and trends using descriptive statistics, histograms, and correlation matrices.
Insights and Recommendations: Summarize findings and propose actionable recommendations to mitigate loan default risks and optimize lending practices.

## Conclusion

Through comprehensive exploratory data analysis, we aim to gain valuable insights into the factors influencing loan default and develop strategies to improve risk assessment and lending decisions. By leveraging data-driven approaches, we strive to minimize financial losses and enhance the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the lending process.
